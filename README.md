This is a python program written to show the basics of what an AI is and is run with the AI_gui.py file.
The Open AI functions is meant to simply make it more advanced as the keywords responses and "Machine Learning" functions are not at all capacable of simulating how it works.
It runs mostly locally excluding the Open AI functions.
The gusser_gui_OS and the calculator_OS.py files are a simple number guessing game and calculator added to flesh out the stuff the program can do, not only reying on its "AI" capabilities can do.
This program is not complete and may have some bugs as it is only something I made to showcase.
It can be added upon and changed and imporved but any commercial use of it must be credited to me even tou I don't think it is good enough for that anyways.
There are no real terms and conditions as it can be used anyhow and is a simple python script so you and I are not liable to any damage(I didnt know what to add at the end to sound professional even thou I am in my teens)
