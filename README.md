This is a python program written to show the basics of what an AI is.
The Open AI functions is meant to simply make it more advanced as the keywords responses and "Machine Learning" functions are not at all capacable of simulating how it works
It runs mostly locally excluding the Open AI functions
The gusser_gui_OS and the calculator_OS.py files are a simple number guessing game and calculator added to flesh out the stuff the program can do, not only reying on its "AI" capabilities can do.
This program is not complete and may have some bugs as it is only something I made to showcase
It can be added upon and changed and imporved but any commercial use of it must be credited to me even tou I don't think it is good enough for that anyways
